**ResourceKit** is a lightweight Swift package for **loading, decoding, and managing local resources** in your app.
Built for modern Swift apps, documented with DocC, and fully tested with Swift Testing.

---

## âœ¨ Features

* âœ… Simple resource loading from app bundles
* âœ… Built-in JSON decoding helpers
* âœ… Clear and structured error reporting (`ResourceError`)
* âœ… **AudioResourcePlayer**: simple, UI-safe playback of bundled audio (segments & looping)
* âœ… Fully documented using DocC
* âœ… Tested using Swift's native [`import Testing`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/testing) framework
* âœ… Designed to be extensible for additional resource types (audio, images, etc.)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Add **ResourceKit** via Swift Package Manager:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/michaelborgmann/ResourceKit.git", from: "0.2.0")
````

Then import it into your code:

```swift
import ResourceKit
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### ðŸ”¹ Load a JSON file

```swift
import ResourceKit

struct Config: Decodable {
    let apiKey: String
}

do {
    let config: Config = try JSON.load(name: "AppConfig")
    print(config.apiKey)
} catch {
    print("Failed to load AppConfig.json:", error)
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Decode JSON from `Data`

```swift
let data = #"{"id": "abc123", "name": "Michael"}"#.data(using: .utf8)!

struct User: Decodable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
}

do {
    let user: User = try JSON.decode(data: data)
    print(user.name)
} catch {
    print("Decoding failed:", error)
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Load raw resource data

```swift
let url = try Resource.url(name: "filename", ext: "json")
let data = try Resource.data(for: url)
```

---

### ðŸ”Š Play a bundled audio file (AudioResourcePlayer)

`AudioResourcePlayer` is a tiny, main-actorâ€“isolated helper for playing **local** audio files (e.g., sounds bundled in your app or test target).
It supports whole-file playback as well as **segment** playback with optional looping.

```swift
import ResourceKit

let player = AudioResourcePlayer()

// Load a file from your bundle (e.g., Tests/Resources/beep.mp3)
try player.load(named: "beep", ext: "mp3", in: .module)

// Whole file
try player.play()

// Or a time slice with looping: play [0.0, 0.25) three times total
try player.play(fromSeconds: 0.0, toSeconds: 0.25, loops: .times(2))
```

> Notes:
>
> * The API is `@MainActor`, making it safe for UI use.
> * Segment playback is drift-free via anchored timers.
> * This is for **local** files; streaming is out of scope.
