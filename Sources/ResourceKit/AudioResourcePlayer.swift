import AVFoundation

/// A lightweight, main-actor–isolated audio player built on top of `AVAudioPlayer`.
///
/// `AudioResourcePlayer` provides a clean, UI-friendly API for loading and controlling audio,
/// with built-in support for precise segment playback and looping.
///
/// ### Features
/// - Load and prepare local audio files from any bundle.
/// - Play, pause, resume, and stop playback.
/// - Control volume and whole-file looping via ``numberOfLoops``.
/// - Play clamped audio **segments** with optional finite or infinite looping.
/// - Drift-free segment scheduling using wall-clock–anchored timers.
///
/// ### Segment Playback
/// In addition to whole-file playback, `AudioResourcePlayer` supports playing **time slices**
/// of an audio file. Segments are scheduled relative to a stable wall-clock anchor to
/// avoid cumulative drift over many loops:
///
/// ```swift
/// try player.play(fromSeconds: 2.0, toSeconds: 4.0, loops: .times(3))
/// ```
///
/// This example plays the range `[2.0, 4.0)` and loops it **3 extra times** (4 total).
/// Segment looping uses internal timers rather than `AVAudioPlayer.numberOfLoops`,
/// giving precise control even for partial slices.
///
/// ### Concurrency & Thread Safety
/// - The entire API is **`@MainActor` isolated** — all state changes calls are
///   guaranteed to happen on the main actor.
/// - Safe for UI-driven use without manual thread management.
/// - Uses a selector-based `Timer` internally, ensuring Swift 6 `@Sendable` safety.
///
/// ### Error Handling
/// All fallible operations throw ``AudioResourcePlayerError``:
/// - ``AudioResourcePlayerError/notLoaded`` — no file was loaded before playback.
/// - ``AudioResourcePlayerError/invalidRange`` — start ≥ end or out-of-bounds segment.
/// - ``AudioResourcePlayerError/playFailed`` — playback could not start.
/// - ``AudioResourcePlayerError/decodeFailed`` — the audio file could not be decoded.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```swift
/// let player = AudioResourcePlayer()
/// try player.load(named: "beep", ext: "mp3", in: .module)
/// player.volume = 0.8
/// try player.play()
/// ```
///
/// ### Limitations
/// - Remote streaming is **not supported** — this is for locally bundled or downloaded files.
/// - For precise musical timing, use `AVAudioPlayer.deviceCurrentTime` and `play(atTime:)`.
///
/// `AudioResourcePlayer` is designed for apps that need **simple, predictable, and safe**
/// audio playback without the complexity of `AVAudioEngine`.
